# MotherTruckerApp
Our project for the 2021 RowdyHacks competition!

Idea:
Many in the trucking industry struggle to find safe/reliable parking at the end of their shift. Our idea is to create an application that enables truck drivers to find safe parking, leave reviews about the location, and even reserve spots ahead of time, similar to how open table allows you to make a reservation at a resturant.
